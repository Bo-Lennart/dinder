# Features

## Navigation

![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](/docs/screenshots/nav_bar.png)

* On the top of the page a navigation bar is displayed. The companys' logo is on the left hand side providing a link to the home page.
* On the mid-right hand side, there are two links: "About" and "Find a Match" which will navigate to these pages.
* The font style and colour of the logo is chosen to present a playful feel that pops against the white background.
* The navigation font is descreet and clean to add contrast to the playfulness and clearly show the user how to navigation through the webpage. 


## Hero Image

* The hero image is chosen to intuitively direct the first user towards what the page is about (dogs). Additionally to clearify the purpose of what Dinder is, a paragraph is added to float over the image with a short description.
