            <p>It all started with a facebook post where Jonanna wanted to find friends for her dog. She made posts on facebook, instagram and tried to reach out in order to find new like minded people in the same situation. Sometimes a new conenction came up but for the most part the post did not reach longer than her own facebook network and eventually dissapeared. So in 2022 she started Dinder to make this process easier. Dinder has helped a lot of people and dogs to find new friend. Some members train together for competitions and others go out running together. A few take walks together or meet up for a pick nick in the park. Your imagination is your limit once you have a match. Our matches are built from the location a member is based, what interest they have and which days they are available. Once you've filled in all information, we Dinder does the rest for you!</p>
