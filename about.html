            <p>It all started with a facebook post where Joanna wanted to find friends for her dog. She made posts and tried to reach out in order to find like minded people in the same situation. Sometimes a new conenction came up but for the most part the posts did not reach longer than her own facebook network and dissapeared. So in 2022 she started Dinder to make this process easier. Dinder has helped herself and a lot of people with dogs to find new friends. Some members train together for competitions and others go out running. A few meet up for a walk or go for a picnic in the park. The members imagination is the limit once they have a match. Our matches are built from location, what interest they have and which days they are available. Once you've filled in all information, Dinder does the rest for you!</p>
